# 摘要
  Calculate the trajectory of our cannon shell including both air drag and the reduced air density at high altitudes so             
  that you can reproduce the results in Figure 2.5. Perform your calculation for different firing angles and determine    
  the value of the angle that gives the maximum range.
# 背景介绍
  From the texbook on page 25：
  The Euler method we used to treat the problem in chapter 1 can easily be generalized to deal with motion in two  
  spatial dimensions. To be specific, we can consider a projectile such as a shell shot by a cannon. If we ignore the
  air resistance, the equations of motion, which are again obtained from Newton's second law, can be written as
                                       d²x/dt²=o  ;  d²y/dt²=-g
  so wo know the relationship between F and F(0)
